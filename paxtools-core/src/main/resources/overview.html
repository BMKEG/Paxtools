Paxtools is a library for accessing and manipulating
<a href="http://www.biopax.org">BioPAX</a>. Software tools that use BioPAX, such
as exporters, importers, analysis algorithms or editors can use Paxtools as
their core BioPAX API. Paxtools supports BioPAX Level 2, and can automatically
convert Level 1 models to Level 2. The latest release candidate for
BioPAX Level 3 is fully supported, but it is still in beta as BioPAX Level 3 is
not finalized yet.

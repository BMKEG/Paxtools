  We present Paxtools a software library that contains algorithms, software 
components and converters for biological pathways represented in the standard 
BioPAX language. Paxtools allows scientists to focus on their scientific 
problem by removing technical barriers to access and analyse pathway information.
Paxtools is open source and is available under the Lesser GNU public license (LGPL), 
which allows users to freely use the code in their software systems with a 
requirement for attribution.

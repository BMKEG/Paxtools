 Paxtools is Java library that contains algorithms, software components and converters for biological pathways
 represented in the standard BioPAX language. Paxtools allows scientists to focus on their scientific problem by
 removing technical barriers to access and analyse pathway information.
 <p>
 Paxtools can run on any platform that has a Java Runtime Environment and was tested on most modern operating
 systems.Paxtools is open source and is available under the Lesser GNU public license (LGPL). The sources
 and release bundles can be obtained from sourceforge.net/projects/biopax/.
 <p>
 Here is a simple "hello world" application:

     BioPAXFactory factory = BioPAXLevel.L3.getDefaultFactory();<p>
     Model model = factory.createModel(); ;<p>
     Protein protein1 = model.addNew(Protein.class,  ;<p>
     "http://biopax.org/tutorial/test1"); ;<p>
     protein1.addName("Tutorial Example Small molecule Transporter 1");   ;<p>
     protein1.setDisplayName("TEST1");;<p>
     ;<p>
     BiochemicalReaction rxn1 = model.addNew(BiochemicalReaction.class,   ;<p>
     "http://biopax.org/tutorial/rxn1");      ;<p>
     rxn1.addLeft(protein1);    ;<p>
